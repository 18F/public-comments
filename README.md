# 18F's Public Comments

Collection of public comments that 18F makes on proposed federal rules and policies.

Comments are posted to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/18F/public-comments/issues?q=).

We try to include links to the original places they were published, if present, and an archive.org snapshot of the document we were commenting on, if available. (If an archive.org snapshot is not available, you can instruct archive.org to make a new snapshot on demand of a given URL, if the site owner's robots.txt doesn't block it.)
